# Multilayer-perceptron

This Python code implements a multilayer propagation algorithm that I learned about in my machine learning course. Data is randomly generated and true labels are computed using a xor function. Forward propagation is utilized to predict labels - once using the sign function and once using tangent. Furthermore, in-sample error is calculated and reported from both the sign implementation and the tangent implementation.
